SCHEDULING IN MIXED CRITICALITY SYSTEMS USING EDF-VD

For compiling the programs, execute:
make or make all

For executing the programs, execute:
./test input.txt output.txt

For removing all the .o files and the executable file, execute:
make clean

Files in the zip file:
1) input.txt: 
    Contains the task set.
    The first line contains the number of tasks.
    Each subsequent line contains the parameters of each task which are:
    Phase, Relative deadline, Criticality level, WCET for each criticality level

2)output.txt:
    Contains the output of the scheduling. Each line will give the information about:
    The type of decision point, 
    Kernel's total execution time, Kernel's current criticality level, The currently executing job, its total execution time, its actual execution time and its absolute deadline.

3)data_structures.h: 
    Contains the information about ADTs used. The ADTs used are:
    task, task_set, job, kernel_struct

4)functions.h:
    Contains the information about the global functions. The global functions used are:
    get_taskset, initialize_kernel, edf_vd_scheduler

5)functions.c:
    Contains the functions required for the offline preprocessing phase and runtime scheduling of the taskset.

6)driver.c: 
    Contains the driver code to run the program. The user is responsible for:
    initializing the taskset using get_taskset function
    initializing the kernel using initialize_kernel function
    running the edf_vd_scheduler function to schedule the taskset.
